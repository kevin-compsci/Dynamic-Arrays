Dynamic Arrays


A basic C program that implements a dynamic array. It supports basic starter functions for now, but can easily be upgraded to support a variety of features. This dynamic array is meant to operate like Java arraylists (Lists) in general. However, pointers and memory management is explicit here for practice and it should be noted that memory (heap) must allocated since the size of the array can only be determined at run-time in our case.
